Reward         &  Positive reward for having only one connected region of open tiles, and positive reward for having a path between the start and goal of at least 20, at most 80. Weighted these in a ratio of 5:2. Negative reward (-100) for a action that removed an existing path. &  Positive reward for having only one connected region of open tiles, and positive reward for having a path between the start and goal of at least 20, at most 80.
